We created a Taj Mahal with an animated pool. Minor features include reflection, tranposed grass, sky, and sun. The pool we created usinga finite number of gl_triangles in a vertices matrix. The speed of the triangles that make up the water surface depend on their neighboring vertices. Basic linear algebra is involved to calculate the normal vectors of the water surface, to determine the next displacement of the triangles. Two agitator points, which represent fish making the perturbations originate the movement of the entire system. In addition, we made the water transparent via blending, two sided light model. The pool also features a reflection. Our Taj Mahal contains 800+ texture surfaces, so we modified the starter code to cache our texture instances. We also wrote the mtl file from scratch and modified lighting, as none of those were provided. The grass consist of 200 transposed instances.
